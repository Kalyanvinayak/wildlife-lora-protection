# Cross-Border Wildlife & Community Protection System

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=Wildlife+%2B+Disaster+Protection+System)

## 🌍 Overview

A comprehensive **LoRa-based environmental monitoring and disaster alert system** designed to protect **wildlife, rural communities, and border areas**. The system uses **solar-powered sensor nodes**, **LED/siren alert infrastructure**, and **shared dashboards** to enable proactive response to **poaching**, **animal movement**, and **natural disasters**, fostering collaboration between **rangers, villagers, and NGOs**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **LoRa-based sensor network** for long-range, low-power communication
* **Solar-powered collar and weather station nodes**
* **Real-time animal tracking and intrusion alerts**
* **Siren & LED public warning system** for villagers
* **Open dashboard** for visualizing wildlife & hazard data
* Supports **community participation** and **multi-agency coordination**

## 📦 Tech Stack

| Layer            | Technologies Used                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Hardware         | LoRa Modules (RA-02), GPS, DHT11, Solar, Buzzers    |
| Firmware         | Embedded C / Arduino                                |
| Data Aggregation | LoRa Gateway (Raspberry Pi or Helium hotspot)       |
| Backend          | Firebase, FastAPI (for alert routing and dashboard) |
| Visualization    | ReactJS / Flutter (for maps & control dashboard)    |

## 🛠 System Architecture

1. **Sensor Nodes**: Animal collars, weather units, motion detectors transmit data over **LoRa**
2. **LoRa Gateway** collects packets and forwards to **cloud backend**
3. **Firebase + FastAPI** stores, processes, and routes alert data
4. **Dashboards** display live mapping and alert logs
5. **Local devices** (sirens, LED boards) triggered via cloud

---

## 📲 Dashboard Features

* Real-time wildlife movement map
* Sensor health monitoring
* Weather and disaster event overlays
* Incident history logging and download

---

## 📡 Hardware Setup

* Solar-powered **collar node** with GPS + gas/humidity sensors
* **LoRa transmitter** to send data periodically
* Villager-end devices with **LED boards + sirens** for local alerts
* Central **LoRa gateway** with internet access

---

## 🔔 Use Cases

* **Wildlife corridors** and border protection
* **Poaching detection** and response
* **Disaster alerts** for floods, forest fires, etc.
* **Cross-agency coordination** for rural and environmental security

---

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Firmware (Node)

```bash
# Flash Arduino code for collars and station nodes
# Configure LoRa parameters and thresholds
```

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Dashboard (ReactJS or Flutter)

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install / flutter pub get
npm start / flutter run
```

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

* AI/ML-based movement prediction
* Integration with national park databases
* Drone-based aerial support integration
* Blockchain for data immutability and transparency

---

## 🤝 Collaborators

* Forest Rangers and Anti-Poaching Units
* Local Villagers and Citizen Science Groups
* NGOs and Disaster Relief Networks
